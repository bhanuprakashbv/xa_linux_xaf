  to select a timer with highest interrupt-priority <= EXCMLEVEL

+ [J2576, J2577] Fixed memory leaks by deleting the timer object in 
  capturer and renderer plugins

+ [J2567] Updated audio-codec-class to reset base state when an 
  output buffer is received after execution completion

+ Renamed pcm_mix component plugin to mimo_mix

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.2_Beta API 1.3 : May 21, 2020

+ Beta release 
+ Built with RI.2 tools
+ Programmers Guide not updated

+ [J2220] Hostless XAF is tested and supported on Fusion cores

+ [J2226, J2464] Unified Hostless XAF release packages across cores

+ [J2543] Fixed a bug by clearing output_setup flag on relaxed output 
  ports during postprocess in MIMO class

+ [J2544] Added reset EOS stream flags in Opus Encoder, PCM Gain, 
  SRC plugin files to enable re-run upon receiving new input

+ [J2545] PCM Gain plugin updated to support 8, 24, 32 bit PCM width
  and multichannel input data

+ [J2546] Fixed a bug in scratch allocation with pre-emptive 
  scheduling - allocated independent scratch for each worker thread

+ [J2553] Fixed a bug in MIMO class postprocess to avoid re-schedule
  if execution is complete

  xaf_adev_close API

  runtime commands to execute while disconnect API is in progress

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.1_Alpha API 1.3 : April 23, 2020

+ Alpha release - HiFi4 only
+ Built with RI.2 tools

+ Changed some non-standard return codes from XAF Developer APIs to
  standards XAF Error codes

+ Updated xaf_comp_get_status API to return EXEC_DONE status for
  components returning output or probe data to application

+ [2453] Enhanced mem_malloc and mem_free wrappers to avoid maximum
  number of allocations allowed constraint

+ [2472] Minimum connect buffers between components requirement is 
  reduced from 2 to 1. Note with this change, MIMO class preprocess
  allows execution if any of input port has non-zero data (earlier,
  it would check for non-zero data on all input ports) 

+ [2473] Moved TRACE control tags to xf-debug.h for better 
  configurability

+ [2475] Fixed bug in renderer disconnect API implementation

+ [2486] Increased auxiliary buffer size from 128 to 256 to allow
  32 configuration parameters in xaf_comp_set_config and 
  xaf_comp_get_config API (shared memory usage increases by 4kB)
 
+ [2491] Updated xaf_get_mem_stats API implementation to report
  peak and current memory usage. Note with this change, the API
  expects pointer to array of five integers as second argument 
  (earlier it expected pointer to array of three integers)

+ [2498] Fixed bug of redundant stack allocation during thread
  creation with FreeRTOS

+ [2513] Reduced input buffer size requirement of Opus encoder
  plugin to hold only one frame

+ [2528] Removed fatal error from capturer class in case of output 
  buffer non-availability, this should be handled by plugin

+ [2530] Updated copyright headers to MIT style for all files

+ Programmers Guide not updated

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0 API 1.3 : January 31, 2020

+ GA Release - HiFi3, HiFi4 and HiFi5 only
+ Built with RI.2 tools

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.8_3_Alpha API 1.3 : December 23, 2019

+ Patch release - HiFi4 only
+ Built with RI.2 tools

+ Added MIMO (Multi-Input, Multi-Output) data processing class.

+ Added following new XAF Developer APIs:
    XAF_ERR_CODE xaf_pause(pVOID p_comp, WORD32 port);
    XAF_ERR_CODE xaf_resume(pVOID p_comp, WORD32 port);
    XAF_ERR_CODE xaf_probe_start(pVOID p_comp);
    XAF_ERR_CODE xaf_probe_stop(pVOID p_comp);
    XAF_ERR_CODE xaf_disconnect(pVOID p_src, WORD32 src_out_port, 
                 pVOID p_dest, WORD32 dest_in_port);

+ Updated prototype for xaf_connect API:
    XAF_ERR_CODE xaf_connect(pVOID p_src, WORD32 src_out_port, 
                 pVOID p_dest, WORD32 dest_in_port, WORD32 num_buf);

+ Added support for FreeRTOS.

+ Added support for preemptive scheduling for both XOS and FreeRTOS.

+ Following updates are done for Renderer Class:
- Changed logic to schedule execution of renderer on each interrupt 
  irrespective of input port readiness
- Added XAF_START_FLAG command support for explicit initialization of 
  renderer
- Added support for additional, optional output port to generate 
  reference or feedback output

+ Following updates are done for Audio Codec Class:
- Updated Audio Codec Class to initialize all components except 
  decoders (comp_type XAF_DECODER) without input data

+ Following updates are done for Renderer Plugin:
- Added actual FIFO in the plugin to mimic hardware operation
- Added state configuration parameter (XA_RENDERER_STATE_START) to 
  start renderer hardware operation (e.g. enable interrupt)
  Note, even if this configuration parameter is not used from 
  application, renderer hardware operation starts once FIFO is full
- Added logic to zero-fill output if real data is not available
  At start, this logic would insert zero frames or prepend zeros to 
  real data, if required
  At runtime, this logic would insert zero frames or append zeros to 
  real data, if required
- Added support for additional, optional output port to generate 
  reference or feedback data
- Moved renderer execution from set_input_bytes() to do_execute() 
  function
- Added logic to set exec-done from plugin when input is over

+ Following updates are done for Capturer Plugin:
- Added state configuration parameter (XA_CAPTURER_STATE_START) to 
  start capturer hardware operation (e.g. enable interrupt)
  Note, this configuration parameter must be issued from application 
  for capturer hardware operation to start
- Moved capturer execution from set_mem_ptr() to do_execute() function

+ Updated initialization API call sequence requirement as - 
  initialization status must be queried by xaf_comp_get_status() API
  after xaf_comp_process(...XAF_START_FLAG) API call. 

+ Corrected Capturer output port number to 0 from 1.

+ Added few robustness fixes as per internal QA testing.

+ Added new example testbenches and plugins to demonstrate usage of 
  new features.

+ Programmers Guide not updated.

+ Notes
 - New feature implementation mentioned above has undergone limited 
   testing and may get updated.
 - By default, this release uses XOS as RTOS.
 - To use FreeRTOS instead of XOS, please refer to instructions in 
   'libxa_af_hostless/build/readme-freertos-bld.txt'.
 - XOS is configured with 100 MHz clock frequency with 0.1 ms timer 
   tick resolution whereas FreeRTOS is configured with 50 MHz clock
   frequency with 1 ms timer tick resolution.
 - Known constraint: MCPS computation and prints are not supported
   with FreeRTOS in this release.
